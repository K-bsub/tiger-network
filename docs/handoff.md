# Handoff — India's Tiger Network

**What this is:** the single rolling context document for this project. One chat
per week. At the **start** of a week's chat, paste or attach this file so the
assistant has full context. At the **end**, update the "Current state" and "Log"
sections and commit. This file is the memory between chats — keep it truthful.

**How to update:** edit "Current state" to match reality, add a dated entry to
the "Log", tick the week off in `project-plan.md`, then commit both together
(`docs: update handoff after Week N`).

## Fixed context (rarely changes)

- **Repo:** https://github.com/K-bsub/tiger-network  ·  local:
  `C:/Users/kiran/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/tiger-network`
- **Site:** https://K-bsub.github.io/tiger-network/
- **Environment:** R 4.5.2, RStudio on Windows; `renv` for reproducibility.
  Quarto is **not** on the Windows PATH — render from R with
  `quarto::quarto_render("site", as_job = FALSE)`.
- **Analysis CRS:** EPSG:7755 (WGS 84 / India NSF LCC).
- **Scope (locked):** three tracks in priority order — (1) Growth, (2)
  Connectivity, (3) Habitat suitability (SDM, **not** occupancy) — plus the
  cross-cutting effort/observer-bias thread. Reserve-level, rolled up to
  landscape complex and state.
- **Fixed Decisions (see `docs/methodology.md`):** D1 suitability not occupancy;
  D2 reserve unit rolled up; D3 CRS 7755.

## Ways of working (apply every chat)

- ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English in all writing.
- No flattery; realistic assessment; surface discrepancies, never silently
  default.
- Decisions before code: raise open forks; Kiran makes the call.
- Deliver **full files**, not snippets. Present only changed files per turn.
- Work at the **file level** (Kiran applies edits and re-uploads corrected
  files; those are the source of truth).
- Pre-registration discipline: fix analytical rules as numbered Decisions
  before looking at results.
- Sensitive-data policy: no precise points published; continuous surfaces
  generalised to ≥1 km; gate publish exports through the assert functions.

## Current state  ·  updated after **Week 3** (reserve boundary layer built)

- **Done this week:** `scripts/02_prepare_boundaries.R` written and run. It builds
  `boundary_reserves_all_7755.gpkg` — **58 reserves, 55 with KML geometry, 3
  geometry-absent** (Amrabad, Pilibhit, Dholpur-Karauli). Also writes
  `boundary_states_7755.gpkg` (36) and a QA report
  (`tbl_02_reserve_build_report.csv`). The five NTCA census reports (2006–2022)
  are on disk (task 3.1). Docs updated: `data-dictionary.md` (new reserve
  schema), `methodology.md` (Week-3 change log + Nagarjunsagar limitation),
  `data-sources.md`, `proposal.md` (§8 deviation), `README.md`, `project-plan.md`
  (Week 3 ✅, Week 4 breakdown added).
- **How reserves are built (important — the KML is not what the plan assumed):**
  the NTCA KML holds **705 protected-area polygons, not reserve entities**. Each
  reserve is built from its constituent PA(s) named in
  `data/raw/ntca/reserve_pa_crosswalk.csv` (hand-reviewed), matched on **name +
  state**, and dissolved to one polygon per `unit_id`. 10 reserves are
  multi-part (e.g. Corbett = Corbett NP + Sonanadi WLS).
- **`area_km2` is a flagged placeholder.** `area_provisional = TRUE`,
  `area_source = wikipedia_ntca_2022_PLACEHOLDER`. **Week 5 overwrites it from
  the NTCA census** (Decision 4) and sets `area_provisional = FALSE`. The
  `area_provisional` column is how to find every row to replace.
- **Next: Week 4** — start the all-reserve census time-series extraction (manual,
  from the five NTCA reports). Make the **missing-year Decision** first
  (numbered). See `project-plan.md` → Week 4 breakdown.

### Crosswalk review rows (carry into Week 5 census join)

6 crosswalk rows are `match_status = review` — accepted and matched, but worth a
glance when the census is joined (they are the name-collision / false-match
cases): **Kamlang, Pench (MP), Pench (MH), Bor, Similipal, Nagarhole**
(KML `Rajiv Gandhi` — the Karnataka one, not the AP duplicate). All resolved in
the build; the flag just marks them for a second look.

### Data on disk (from Week 2, via `scripts/01` — unchanged)

All on the 1 km EPSG:7755 grid where raster.
- **GBIF tiger occ** — 4,606 pts (DOI 10.15468/dl.npxmxx). Median coord
  uncertainty ~30 km — heavy cleaning drop expected in Week 13.
- **GBIF Mammalia background** — 39,057 pts, 2006–2022 (DOI 10.15468/dl.2d523e).
- **WorldCover 2021** — 1 km modal class (all 11 classes present).
- **gHM 2022** — 1 km, mean 0.377.
- **OSM** — roads 885,669 (major, tertiary-dominated); settlements 199,800
  (**village-dominated ~195k** — likely needs trimming for the KDE).
- **Terrain** — elevation/slope/TRI, 1 km (elevatr AWS z7). Full-India coverage.
- **Admin boundaries** — Natural Earth states (36) + DataMeet Census-2011
  districts (641). Districts are pre-redistricting vintage.
- **Manual PDFs:** ISFR 2021 Ch.4, Singh & Sen 2015, **and the five NTCA census
  reports (2006–2022)** — the census figures still need manual extraction
  (Weeks 4–5); the reports are only on disk, not yet parsed.

### Boundary Decision (Decision 4 — settled Week 2, as-built Week 3)

- **Chosen:** NTCA DSS `PA_TR_Corridor_Final` KML as the single geometry source.
  Reserve **area/density come from the NTCA census, not the KML polygon** (the
  polygon under-states the legal total; as-built poly/census ratio median ~0.58).
- **As-built refinements (Week 3):** the "2 false matches" (Bor, Kamlang) were
  name-lookup artefacts — both have correct in-state polygons and are matched.
  Real gaps are the 3 above. Corridors are **named polygons**, not unnamed
  centrelines. Full detail in `methodology.md` (Week-3 change log).
- **Raw:** `data/raw/ntca/PA_TR_Corridor_Final/`.

### Open pending Decisions (decide in the week noted)

Full text in `methodology.md` → "Decisions pending".
- **[Week 4]** Missing-year census handling (the Kaziranga-2006 problem, at
  scale) — **due next week, before entering census data.**
- **[Week 8–9]** Settlement layer for the KDE — village-dominated (~195k);
  trim to city/town (4,597) or change radius?
- **[Week 9]** Land-cover resistance values (starting set in `R/00_config.R`).
- **[Week 9]** Road classes for the barrier surface — keep tertiary or restrict
  to motorway–secondary?
- **[Week 13–14]** Target-group scope — all Mammalia vs large-bodied guild.
- **[Week 14]** Terrain variables in the SDM — collinearity check (slope vs TRI).

### Known gotchas (do not relearn)

- **NTCA KML — the GDAL driver mangles it; parse with `xml2`.** The KML
  `PA_TR_Corridor_Final.kml` (a) has its attribute fields (`DESIG`, `state_name`,
  `Corridor`) inside `SchemaData/SimpleData`, which the GDAL/LIBKML driver
  **drops** (an `st_read` shows only `Name`/`Description`/`geometry`), and (b) is
  split by the driver into **two layers** (`PA_TR_Corridors` = 764, `corridor` =
  156), so a plain `st_read` sees 764 features and no fields. `scripts/02`
  therefore parses the KML with **`xml2`** and rebuilds geometry from ring
  coordinates. Do not switch it back to `st_read`. Also: `st_as_sfc()` on a KML
  geometry snippet **returns empty geometries** for this file's
  MultiGeometry/altitudeMode structure — that path was tried and abandoned. New
  dependency: `xml2` (run `renv::snapshot()` if not already locked).
- **KML layer named `corridor` is NOT the corridors.** The GDAL `corridor` layer
  (156 features) holds the **unnamed duplicate** placemarks. The real corridors
  (59) sit inside the `PA_TR_Corridors` layer, tagged by the `Corridor` field.
- **`unit_name` is not a unique key.** Two `Pench` (MP + MH) and two
  `Rajiv Gandhi` (Karnataka + AP) exist in the KML. Any KML→reserve match must
  use **name + state**, never name alone. `scripts/02` does; keep it that way.
- **`area_km2` is provisional until Week 5.** The reserve layer's `area_km2` is a
  placeholder (`area_provisional = TRUE`). Do not treat it as census area until
  Week 5 overwrites it and flips the flag to `FALSE`.
- **First GitHub Pages publish:** the Action deploys to `gh-pages` but cannot
  create it. Bootstrap the branch once from the **Terminal tab** (not R
  console): `quarto publish gh-pages site`. Do **not** use
  `quarto::quarto_publish_site(server="gh-pages")` — that R wrapper targets
  Posit Connect and misreads `gh-pages` as a hostname.
- **`rlang` lock:** if a package update says "cannot remove prior installation"
  or "namespace already loaded, >= X required", restart R and run
  `install.packages()` as the **first** action, before anything auto-loads it.
- **`gh-pages` branch shows source as "deleted":** correct. That branch holds
  only rendered HTML; source stays on `main`.
- **`00b` reads `data/data_manifest.csv`** as the expected inventory (not
  `data-sources.md`).
- **The audit checks file *presence*, not *coverage*.** A `PRESENT` result means
  "a matching file exists in the folder", nothing more. When real data is staged
  in Week 2+, do not read a `PRESENT` on `ntca_census` as "the census is done" —
  the all-reserve census is manual extraction (Weeks 4–5) and the audit cannot
  see whether a file holds 7 reserves or all of them.
- **`00b` glob is recursive and case-insensitive.** A stray matching file in a
  nested subfolder still counts as `PRESENT`. Keep `data/raw/<subfolder>/` clean
  so a leftover file does not create a false `PRESENT`.
- **PROJ / PostGIS `proj.db` clash (this machine).** PostgreSQL 16 / PostGIS 3.6
  puts an old `proj.db` on PATH
  (`C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\share\contrib\postgis-3.6\proj\proj.db`,
  LAYOUT.VERSION.MINOR = 2 — an ancient PROJ). GDAL/terra load that instead of
  their own, so **every reprojection to EPSG:7755 fails** with `empty srs` /
  `[project] cannot get output boundaries for the target crs`. This is NOT a code
  bug — the CRS engine is reading a corrupt database. Fix: pin `PROJ_LIB` to
  terra's bundled `proj.db` in the project `.Rprofile`, set **before** terra
  loads (after `renv/activate.R`). Verify in a fresh session with
  `crs(rast(crs="EPSG:7755"))` — it must print the "India NSF LCC" WKT. The env
  var must be set in a clean session; setting it after terra is already loaded
  does not take (PROJ caches the path at first use).

## Weekly log (newest first)

### Week 3 — Reserve boundary layer built · 2026-09-11
- Entry state: all covariates + admin boundaries + NTCA DSS KML on disk; boundary
  layer not built; the five NTCA census reports not yet downloaded.
- Did:
  - **Task 3.1** — downloaded the five NTCA All India Tiger Estimation reports
    (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022) into `data/raw/ntca/` (PDF; no Excel).
  - **Tasks 3.2–3.6** — wrote and ran `scripts/02_prepare_boundaries.R`. Built
    `boundary_reserves_all_7755.gpkg` (58 reserves: 55 geometry + 3 absent) and
    `boundary_states_7755.gpkg` (36). Built the hand-reviewed
    `reserve_pa_crosswalk.csv` (58 reserves → constituent KML PA names + a
    provisional area placeholder). Added QA columns (`poly_km2`,
    `poly_census_ratio`) and a build report (`tbl_02_reserve_build_report.csv`).
    Preserved the 156 unnamed KML duplicates to
    `data/interim/boundary_kml_unattributed_7755.gpkg`.
  - Updated docs: `data-dictionary.md` (new reserve schema), `methodology.md`
    (Week-3 change log + Nagarjunsagar limitation), `data-sources.md`,
    `proposal.md` (§8), `README.md`, `project-plan.md` (Week 3 ✅ + Week 4 tasks).
- Decisions made: none numbered (Decision 4 unchanged; the Week-3 change log
  records the as-built refinements to it).
- Outputs: `scripts/02`, `boundary_reserves_all_7755.gpkg`,
  `boundary_states_7755.gpkg`, `boundary_kml_unattributed_7755.gpkg`,
  `reserve_pa_crosswalk.csv`, `tbl_02_reserve_build_report.csv`, updated docs.
- Gotchas found (all now in "Known gotchas"): GDAL KML driver drops the
  SchemaData fields and splits the file into two layers → parse with `xml2`;
  `st_as_sfc()` on KML snippets returns empty geometry; the KML `corridor` layer
  is actually the 156 duplicates; `unit_name` is not unique (two Pench, two Rajiv
  Gandhi) → match on name + state. New dependency: `xml2`.
- Data QA: polygon/census ratio median ~0.58 (expected — polygons under-state the
  legal total). One outlier — Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam ratio 1.54 (coarse source
  geometry; not an Amrabad overlap; area is census-sourced so no metric affected)
  — documented in `methodology.md` Limitations.
- Carried forward / next week: **Week 4** — extract the all-reserve census time
  series from the five NTCA reports (manual). Make the **missing-year Decision**
  first (numbered). 6 crosswalk `review` rows to glance at when joining the
  census. `area_km2` overwrite from census happens in Week 5.

### Week 2 (part) — Admin boundaries + Week-2 close · 2026-09-07
- Entry state: covariates + boundary KML acquired; admin + manual downloads
  pending.
- Did: added `scripts/01` Block 8 — Natural Earth states (36) + DataMeet
  Census-2011 districts (641), scripted, reprojected to 7755. Fetched the manual
  PDFs by hand (ISFR 2021 Ch.4, Singh & Sen 2015). **Did NOT download the NTCA
  census reports** — deferred to Week 3 (task 3.1). Re-ran `00b`: **12/14
  PRESENT** (the 2 MISSING are the rejected KBA/WDPA sources — by design). Fixed
  admin/terrain/settlement manifest globs. `renv::snapshot()` (adds osmextract,
  elevatr, rnaturalearthhires). Confirmed no data staged for commit.
- Decisions made: none new (Decisions 4 + 5 already logged; 4 new pending
  Decisions added to methodology this week).
- Outputs: admin boundary layers; updated `data-sources.md`, `references.md`,
  `methodology.md`, `data_manifest.csv`, `project-plan.md` (Week 2 ✅), this
  handoff.
- Gotchas found: `ne_states()` needs `rnaturalearthhires` (not on CRAN — install
  from `https://ropensci.r-universe.dev`). Streamed/windowed pulls and
  osmextract/elevatr outputs needed manifest glob fixes to audit PRESENT (the
  default globs assume download-to-disk files).
- Carried forward / next week: **Week 3** — download the five NTCA census
  reports (task 3.1); build the reserve boundary layer from the KML
  (`scripts/02`); resolve the 3 unmatched + 2 false-matched reserves.

### Week 2 (part) — Scripted data downloads · 2026-09-07
- Entry state: boundary Decision made; `data/raw/` otherwise empty.
- Did: wrote and ran `scripts/01` blocks 1–7 — India boundary (Natural Earth),
  GBIF tiger occ + Mammalia background, WorldCover (1 km modal), gHM 2022 (1 km),
  OSM roads + settlements (Geofabrik via osmextract), terrain (elevatr AWS z7,
  elevation/slope/TRI). All covariates on the 1 km EPSG:7755 grid. Verified
  terrain covers full India. Fixed several manifest glob/subpath mismatches so
  `00b` audits the streamed/windowed pulls correctly (6 PRESENT).
- Decisions made: none numbered this entry (Decision 5 — Mammalia target group —
  was logged with the GBIF work). Several forks surfaced for end-of-week
  pending Decisions: road classes, settlement filtering, terrain variable
  selection.
- Outputs: interim covariate layers (`cov_landcover_..._1km_7755.tif`,
  `cov_ghm2022_1km_7755.tif`, `cov_terrain_1km_7755.tif`), raw GBIF/OSM/terrain,
  updated docs + manifest.
- Gotchas found: **PROJ/PostGIS `proj.db` clash** (see Known gotchas — cost most
  of this session; fixed via `.Rprofile` PROJ_LIB pin). WorldCover 10 m national
  reproject fails / is far too slow — reproject each tile to a 1 km template
  instead. osmextract needs `max_file_size` raised for the 1.5 GB India pbf, and
  an interrupted convert leaves a locked `.gpkg` (delete it + restart R).
- Carried forward / next week: manual downloads (2.6); then re-audit, commit,
  and write the end-of-week pending Decisions.

### Week 2 (part) — Boundary-source Decision · 2026-09-07
- Entry state: `00a` clean; `renv` locked; `data/raw/` empty; `00b` all 13
  MISSING; boundary source not chosen.
- Did: ran task 2.1 (boundary feasibility). Verified three candidate sources
  against the 58 official reserves. **WII** authoritative layer not publicly
  downloadable. **WDPA** holds zero Indian national PAs (India country profile:
  "national designations only = 0"; the extract is Ramsar/WHS only, 63 polygons)
  — rejected. **KBA** 51/58, core-PA area only, no corridors. **NTCA DSS KML**
  55/58 + corridors, core-PA area only. Chose the KML (Option C): geometry from
  KML, area/density from the NTCA census. Recovered KML provenance from the
  Phase-2 project docs (no re-download needed).
- Decisions made: **Decision 4 — Reserve boundary source and area basis**
  (methodology.md).
- Outputs: `scripts/00c_verify_wdpa_boundaries.R`,
  `outputs/tables/tbl_00_kba_tr_match.csv`. Updated `methodology.md`,
  `data-sources.md`, `data/data_manifest.csv`, `README.md`, this handoff.
- Gotchas found: WDPA India national layer does not exist publicly — do not
  re-attempt. KBA and the NTCA KML both store the **core PA polygon, not the
  legal TR extent** — never derive reserve area from either geometry.
- Carried forward / next week: finish Week-2 downloads (tasks 2.4–2.9); in
  Week 3 fix the 3 unmatched + 2 false-matched reserves when building the
  boundary layer.

### Week 1 — Setup + data audit · 2026-09-06
- Entry state: scaffold on `main`; `gh-pages` live (placeholder site); no data
  re-acquired; `renv` not initialised; no analysis.
- Did: ran `00a` (toolchain clean — GDAL 3.12.1 / GEOS 3.14.1 / PROJ 9.7.1;
  EPSG:7755 resolves). Reviewed prior-project disk contents; decided the
  surviving Phase 1 files (7-reserve census, ISFR 2017, 7-reserve corridors) are
  not usable for an all-reserve analysis, so left `data/raw/` empty. Ran `00b`
  audit (all 13 MISSING — the honest baseline). Ran `renv::init()` + `snapshot()`
  (124 packages; R 4.5.2 pinned).
- Decisions made: (none numbered; note the working call to reject Phase 1 data
  as insufficient — logged here, not a methodology Decision)
- Outputs: `outputs/tables/tbl_00_data_audit.csv`, `renv.lock`
- Gotchas found: audit checks presence not coverage; `00b` glob is recursive +
  case-insensitive (see "Known gotchas").
- Carried forward / next week: Week 2 closes the data gap the audit found and
  makes the **boundary-source Decision** (WII TR vs KBA fallback).

### Week 0 — Scaffolding · 2026-09-06
- Built the full repo scaffold in R (config, IO + sensitive functions, 11
  numbered script stubs, 8 docs, Quarto site, GitHub Action).
- Fixed Decisions 1–3.
- Committed and pushed `main`; bootstrapped `gh-pages`; site live with
  placeholder pages.
- **Carried forward:** three pending Decisions (Weeks 2/4/9); data audit is the
  Week 1 job.
