# India's Tiger Network

**Growth, connectivity and habitat suitability across India's tiger reserves**

A reproducible, open-source spatial analysis built entirely in R.
Scales up and ports to R the two earlier wild cat projects:
[tiger-conservation-india](https://github.com/K-bsub/tiger-conservation-india)
(Phase 1 growth, ArcGIS) and its planned Phase 2 connectivity study.
Sibling in method to
[bay-area-wildcats](https://github.com/K-bsub/bay-area-wildcats).

| **Author** | Kiran Balasubramanian |
| **Status** | **Scaffolding — Week 0.** Repository, R environment, and documentation set are in place. No analysis has run. First working step is the data audit (`scripts/00b_audit_data.R`), which checks which prior-project datasets are still on disk. |
| **Focal species** | *Panthera tigris* (Bengal tiger) |
| **Study area** | India — all tiger reserves with reserve-level census data |
| **Primary unit** | Reserve, rolled up to landscape complex and state |
| **Analysis CRS** | EPSG:7755 — WGS 84 / India NSF LCC (national equal-area/conformal frame) |
| **Stack** | R (sf, terra, spatstat, sfdep, leastcostpath, igraph, maxnet), Quarto, Leaflet |
| **Story site** | Planned — Quarto site on GitHub Pages, one page per analysis track |

## What this project is (and is not)

This is a **port and scale-up**, not a new subject. Three earlier pieces of
work feed into it:

- **Phase 1 (complete, ArcGIS):** tiger population growth 2006–2022 for
  **7 featured reserves**. Growth, KDE, and Gi* hot spots.
- **Phase 2 (proposed, never run, ArcGIS):** corridor connectivity and threat
  mapping for the **same 7 reserves**.
- **Bay Area wild cats (complete, R):** the connectivity + occupancy R
  toolchain, docs discipline, and sensitive-data policy reused here.

This project runs **three analyses in R for all reserves**, not seven:

| Priority | Track | Method | Prior basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Growth** | Per-reserve census metrics 2006–2022, animated choropleth | Phase 1, scaled 7 → all |
| 2 | **Connectivity** | Least-cost paths + reserve-network graph | Phase 2 plan, ported ArcGIS → R |
| 3 | **Habitat suitability** | SDM (`maxnet`), sampling-bias corrected | New; the honest form of "occupancy" |
| — | **Effort / observer bias** | Woven through all three as a caveat | Signature thread from both prior projects |

### Why "habitat suitability", not "occupancy"

Occupancy models need a **detection history** — repeat visits to defined sites
with detection / non-detection. Opportunistic GBIF tiger records cannot supply
one: Phase 1 kept only ~116 clean baseline points and found strong observer
bias (the Ranthambore cold-spot result). This project therefore models
**habitat suitability (SDM)** from occurrence data, which is defensible with
those data, and does **not** claim occupancy. This is fixed as a Decision
before any modelling — see `docs/methodology.md`.

## Getting started

```r
# 1. Open tiger-network.Rproj in RStudio

# 2. Install and verify the spatial toolchain (GDAL/GEOS/PROJ) first
source("scripts/00a_setup_environment.R")

# 3. AUDIT what is still on disk from prior projects (space was reclaimed;
#    some downloads may be gone). This reads docs/data-sources.md as the
#    expected inventory and reports present / missing / moved.
source("scripts/00b_audit_data.R")     # writes outputs/tables/tbl_00_data_audit.csv

# 4. First time only — initialise the reproducible environment
install.packages("renv")
renv::init()          # then renv::snapshot(); commit renv.lock

# 5. Re-acquire only what the audit reports missing (see data/README.md),
#    then run the pipeline in order
source("scripts/01_download_open_data.R")
source("scripts/02_prepare_boundaries.R")
# ... etc.
```
